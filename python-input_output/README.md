# üìò Python - Input/Output

---

## üéØ Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

- Why Python programming is awesome  
- How to open a file  
- How to write text in a file  
- How to read the full content of a file  
- How to read a file line by line  
- How to move the cursor in a file  
- How to make sure a file is closed after using it  
- What is and how to use the `with` statement  
- What is JSON  
- What is serialization  
- What is deserialization  
- How to convert a Python data structure to a JSON string  
- How to convert a JSON string to a Python data structure  
- How to access command line parameters in a Python script  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`  
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using `python3` (version 3.8.5)  
- All your files should end with a new line  
- The first line of all your files should be exactly:  
  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/python3
  ```
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the project folder, is **mandatory**  
- Your code should follow the **pycodestyle** (version 2.7.*)  
- All your files must be **executable**  
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`  

---

## üß™ Python Test Cases

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`  
- All your test files should end with a new line  
- All your test files should be inside a folder named `tests`  
- All your test files should be text files (`.txt` extension)
- All your **modules** and **functions** must include proper documentation.

- Module Documentation

  - To check if a module is documented, run:

  ```bash
  python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'
  ```

  -To check if a function is properly documented, run the following command:

  ```bash
  python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'
  ```

  >‚ÑπÔ∏è **Documentation Requirements**
  >
  >Documentation must be a **complete sentence** that clearly explains the purpose of a **module**, **class**, or **function**.
  >
  > ‚ùó One-word or vague comments are not accepted ‚Äî **clarity and length will be verified**.
