# 🐍 Python - Hello, World

Welcome to my first Python project as part of my journey at **Holberton School**! 
This project introduces the basics of the Python programming language, including how to run scripts, use the interpreter, print messages, manipulate strings, and follow Python’s coding style guidelines.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This project marks the beginning of learning Python. You'll explore how to write your first scripts, understand string operations, and follow proper coding standards using `pycodestyle`.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- ✅ How to use the Python interpreter
- ✅ How to print text and variables using `print()`
- ✅ What strings are and how to use them
- ✅ What indexing and slicing mean in Python
- ✅ What the official Python coding style is
- ✅ How to check your code with `pycodestyle`

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

- ✅ Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- ✅ Python version: `3.8.*` (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS)
- ✅ Each file must end with a new line
- ✅ The first line of each script should be:
  ```python
  #!/usr/bin/python3
  ```

---

## ✅ Additional Requirements

- All Python files must be **executable**
- Code must follow **pycodestyle** version `2.7.*`
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is **mandatory**
- File length may be checked using the `wc` command

---

## 📏 Style Guide - Pycodestyle

This project introduces **PEP8** (also known as `pycodestyle`), Python’s official style guide.  
While Holberton may not enforce all the rules strictly at first, following these conventions helps ensure that your code is:

- Clean 🧼  
- Readable 📖  
- Professional 💼
