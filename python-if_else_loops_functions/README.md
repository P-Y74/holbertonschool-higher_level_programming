# üêç Python - if/else, loops, functions

Welcome to the second step in your Python journey at **Holberton School**!

This project focuses on control structures and function basics in Python, key components for writing logic-driven, modular programs.

---

## üìö Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to explain the following concepts clearly ‚Äî without using Google:

### ‚úÖ General Concepts

- Why **indentation** is crucial in Python
- How to use `if`, `if ... else`, and nested conditions
- The role of **comments** and how to write them
- How to **assign values to variables**
- How to use **`while`** and **`for`** loops
- How to use `break` and `continue` statements
- How to use `else` clauses on loops
- What the `pass` statement does and when to use it
- How to use the `range()` function
- What a **function** is and how to define and call it
- What happens if a function has no `return` statement
- Understanding the **scope** of variables
- What a **traceback** is and how to interpret it
- Arithmetic operators and how to use them in Python

üìù *Note: You do not need to understand lists yet.*

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

### üêç Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All scripts will be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using Python 3.8.*
- All files must end with a **new line**
- The **first line** of each file must be:
  ```python
  #!/usr/bin/python3
  ```

---

## üìÑ Project Standards & Code Style

- A `README.md` file at the **root of the project folder** is **mandatory**
- All Python files must be **executable**
- Code must strictly follow **pycodestyle** (version **2.7.\***)
- File length may be checked using the `wc` command

## üìè Python Style Guide ‚Äî Pycodestyle (PEP8)

This project follows the **PEP8** style guide (also known as **pycodestyle**), the official coding standard for Python.

Although Holberton School may not enforce every PEP8 rule strictly in the beginning, adhering to these standards ensures that your code is:

- ‚úÖ Clean  
- ‚úÖ Readable  
- ‚úÖ Maintainable  
- ‚úÖ Professional

Use the following command to check your code style locally:

```bash
pycodestyle your_script.py
```
