# üêç Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

Welcome to the next step in your Python journey at **Holberton School**!  
This project introduces two essential data structures in Python: **lists** and **tuples**.  
You‚Äôll learn how to manipulate them, when to use each, and explore powerful Python features like **list comprehensions**, **sequence unpacking**, and more.

---

## üìö Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to explain the following concepts clearly ‚Äî without using Google:

### ‚úÖ General Concepts

- What are **lists** and how to use them
- Differences and similarities between **strings** and **lists**
- The most common **methods of lists** and how to use them
- Using **lists as stacks and queues**
- What are **list comprehensions** and how to use them
- What are **tuples** and how to use them
- When to use **tuples vs lists**
- What is a **sequence**
- What is **tuple packing** and **unpacking**
- How to use the `del` statement

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

### üêç Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All scripts will be interpreted using **Python 3.8.5** on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS**
- All Python files must:
  - End with a **new line**
  - Be **executable**
  - Start with the following shebang:
    ```python
    #!/usr/bin/python3
    ```
  - Follow **pycodestyle** (version **2.7.\***)

To check your file length:
```bash
wc your_file.py
```

## üìè Python Style Guide ‚Äî Pycodestyle (PEP8)

This project follows the official Python style guide: **PEP8**, also known as **pycodestyle**.

To ensure your code is clean and professional, check your scripts using:

```bash
pycodestyle your_script.py
```
PEP8 ensures that your Python code is:
