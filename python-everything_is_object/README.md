# Python - Everything is Object

This project is part of the **Full Stack Web Development** curriculum at **Holberton School**.  
It is designed to deepen your understanding of how Python works under the hood, especially regarding objects, memory references, mutability, and variable handling.

Unlike most coding projects, the first part of this one consists solely of **theoretical questions** related to Python's internals. You are encouraged to read the official Python documentation thoroughly, think carefully, and brainstorm before writing a single line of code.

---

## üß† Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to **clearly explain** the following concepts without needing Google:

### General Concepts

- What is an object
- The difference between a class and an object/instance
- The difference between immutable and mutable objects
- What is a reference and an assignment
- What is an alias
- How to know if two variables are **identical**
- How to know if two variables **point to the same object**
- How to display a variable's **identifier (memory address)** in CPython
- What are the **built-in mutable types**
- What are the **built-in immutable types**
- How Python **passes variables to functions**

---

## üßæ Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- Python version: **3.8.5**
- All files interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS**
- All files must end with a new line
- First line of every script must be:
  ```python
  #!/usr/bin/python3
  ```
- All code must follow **pycodestyle** (version **2.7.\***)
- All Python files must be **executable**
- File lengths will be tested using **wc**

---

### üóíÔ∏è .txt Answer Files

- Only **one line per file**
- **No shebang line** (`#!/usr/bin/python3`)
- All `.txt` files must **end with a new line**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Instructions

Do not guess answers or test them directly in the interpreter without deep reflection.

- First, **read the official Python documentation** thoroughly.
- **Think**, **reason**, then **write**.
- You may check your understanding later with the interpreter ‚Äî not before.

### üè´ About

This project focuses on **fundamental Python internals** that are often overlooked but crucial for **technical interviews** and writing robust, idiomatic code.

You‚Äôll explore how Python handles:

- **Object identity vs equality**
- **Memory references and variable assignments**
- **Mutable vs immutable types**
- **Aliasing and scope**
