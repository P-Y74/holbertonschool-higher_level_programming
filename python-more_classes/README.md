# üêç Python - More Classes and Objects

Welcome to another step in mastering **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** with Python!  
This project will deepen your understanding of classes and objects, including advanced concepts such as class attributes, methods, properties, and special methods.

---

## üìö Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain clearly ‚Äî without Google ‚Äî the following concepts:

### ‚úÖ General Concepts

- Why Python programming is awesome  
- What is OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)  
- The idea of ‚Äúfirst-class everything‚Äù  
- What is a class  
- What is an object and an instance  
- Differences between a class, an object, and an instance  
- What is an attribute  
- Public, protected, and private attributes: what they are and how to use them  
- What is `self`  
- What is a method  
- The special `__init__` method and how to use it  
- Concepts of Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding  
- What is a property  
- Differences between an attribute and a property in Python  
- Pythonic ways to write getters and setters  
- The special methods `__str__` and `__repr__`, and how to use them  
- Differences between `__str__` and `__repr__`  
- What is a class attribute  
- Differences between object attributes and class attributes  
- What is a class method  
- What is a static method  
- How to dynamically create new attributes for existing class instances  
- How to bind attributes to objects and classes  
- What is `__dict__` for a class and for an instance, and what it contains  
- How Python finds attributes of an object or class  
- How to use the `getattr` function

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

### General

- All files will be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using **python3 (version 3.8.5)**  
- All files should end with a **new line**  
- The first line of all files must be exactly:  
  ```python
  #!/usr/bin/python3
  ```
- A **README.md** file at the root of the project folder is **mandatory**  
- Code must follow **pycodestyle** (version 2.7.*)  
- All files must be **executable**  
- File length will be checked using `wc`

## üìè Python Style Guide ‚Äî Pycodestyle (PEP8)

This project follows the official Python style guide: **PEP8**, also known as **pycodestyle**.

To ensure your code is clean and professional, check your scripts using:

```bash
pycodestyle your_script.py
```
## üìè Python Style Guide ‚Äî PEP8

PEP8 ensures that your Python code is:

- ‚úÖ **Readable**
- ‚úÖ **Consistent**
- ‚úÖ **Easy to maintain**
