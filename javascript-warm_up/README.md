# JavaScript - Warm up

## üìå Background Context

JavaScript is a versatile programming language used for many purposes. In this project, you will explore JavaScript for two main reasons:

- **Scripting**, similar to what you might have done with Python  
- **Web front-end development**

---

## üìö Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to confidently explain to anyone, without using Google:

- Why JavaScript programming is amazing  
- How to run a JavaScript script  
- How to declare variables and constants  
- Differences between `var`, `let`, and `const`  
- All available JavaScript data types  
- How to use `if` and `if ... else` statements  
- How to write comments  
- How to assign values to variables  
- How to use `while` and `for` loops  
- How to use `break` and `continue` statements  
- What functions are and how to use them  
- What a function returns if it has no explicit `return` statement  
- Variable scope  
- Arithmetic operators and how to use them  
- How to manipulate objects (dictionaries)  
- How to import and use files  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`  
- All files will be interpreted on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using `node` (version 14.x)  
- All files should end with a newline  
- The first line of every file must be exactly:  
  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/node
  ```  
- A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory  
- Code must follow semistandard style (version 16.x.x), which is the Standard style with semicolons; the AirBnB style guide can be used as a reference  
- All files must be executable  
- File lengths will be tested using `wc`

## üì¶ Installation Instructions

To set up your environment, install Node.js version 14 and semistandard linter:

```bash
# Install Node 14
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# Install semistandard globally
sudo npm install semistandard --global
```
