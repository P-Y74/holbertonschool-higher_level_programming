# 🐍 Python - Classes and Objects

Welcome to another essential step in your Python journey at **Holberton School**!  
This project will help you master **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python — a fundamental paradigm for writing clean, reusable, and modular code.

---

## 📚 Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain clearly — without Google — the following concepts:

### ✅ General

- What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- The meaning of “first-class everything”
- What is a **class**
- What is an **object** and an **instance**
- Difference between a class and an object/instance
- What is an **attribute**
- How to use **public**, **protected**, and **private** attributes
- What is **self**
- What is a **method**
- What is the special `__init__` method and how to use it
- What are **Data Abstraction**, **Data Encapsulation**, and **Information Hiding**
- What is a **property**
- Difference between an attribute and a property in Python
- Pythonic way to write **getters** and **setters**
- How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances
- How to bind attributes to objects and classes
- What is the `__dict__` of a class or instance and what it contains
- How Python finds attributes of an object or class
- How to use the `getattr` function

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

### 🐍 Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`  
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using **python3 (version 3.8.5)**  
- All files should end with a **new line**  
- The first line of all your files must be exactly:  
  ```python
  #!/usr/bin/python3
  ```

- A **README.md** file at the root of the project folder is **mandatory**.
- Your code must respect **pycodestyle** (version 2.7.*).
- All your files must be **executable**.
- File length will be checked using `wc`.
- All your **modules** and **functions** must include proper documentation.

- Module Documentation

  - To check if a module is documented, run:

  ```bash
  python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'
  ```

  -To check if a function is properly documented, run the following command:

  ```bash
  python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'
  ```

  >ℹ️ **Documentation Requirements**
  >
  >Documentation must be a **complete sentence** that clearly explains the purpose of a **module**, **class**, or **function**.
  >
  > ❗ One-word or vague comments are not accepted — **clarity and length will be verified**.

## 📏 Python Style Guide — Pycodestyle (PEP8)

This project follows the official Python style guide: **PEP8**, also known as **pycodestyle**.

To ensure your code is clean and professional, check your scripts using:

```bash
pycodestyle your_script.py
```

---

## 📏 PEP8 Compliance

PEP8 ensures that your Python code is:

- ✅ **Readable**
- ✅ **Consistent**
- ✅ **Easy to maintain**
