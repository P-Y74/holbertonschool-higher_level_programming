# 🐍 Python - Serialization

Welcome to the **Python Serialization** project!  
In this project, you will explore the essential concepts of **marshaling** and **serialization** — key techniques in computer science that allow data to be stored, transmitted, and reconstructed reliably across different systems.

---

## 📚 Introduction

Serialization and marshaling are fundamental processes that enable data interchange and persistence:

- **Marshaling**: The process of transforming memory objects into a transferable format, often binary, to facilitate communication across networks or platforms. It is widely used in remote procedure calls (RPC) and distributed systems.

- **Serialization**: The conversion of data structures or object states into formats like JSON, XML, or binary, which can be saved or transmitted. Serialization allows the state of an object to be preserved and recreated later or elsewhere.

This project will deepen your understanding and practical skills in handling serialized data for real-world applications such as web development, databases, and network communication.

---

## 📚 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Clearly articulate the differences and similarities between **marshaling** and **serialization**.  
- Implement serialization techniques in Python programs.  
- Understand the applications of serialization in web apps, databases, and network communication.  
- Evaluate and compare the performance of various serialization formats such as **JSON**, **XML**, **CSV**, and **pickle**.

## ⚙️ Project Requirements

### 🐍 Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`  
- All scripts will be tested on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using **python3 (version 3.8.5)**  
- All files must end with a **new line**  
- The first line of all files must be exactly:  
  ```python
  #!/usr/bin/python3
  ```
- A **README.md** file at the root of the project folder is **mandatory**.  
- Your code must follow **pycodestyle** (version 2.7.*).  
- All your files must be **executable**.  
- File length will be checked using `wc`.  

---

## 🧪 Python Test Cases

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`  
- All test files must end with a **new line**.  
- All test files must be inside a folder named `tests`.  
- Test files must be text files with the `.txt` extension.
